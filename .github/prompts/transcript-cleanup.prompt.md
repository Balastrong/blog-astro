If there is no `subtitles.md` file in the project root, reply with exactly:

"No subtitles file found, put it in the root of the project and try again."

# Task

You will cleanup the content of `subtitles.md`.

Your task is to correct any transcription errors, such as misspellings or misheard words, and add appropriate punctuation and capitalization to make the subtitles readable.

Do not rewrite or rephrase the content for style or clarity, only fix likely transcription mistakes and basic formatting issues (e.g., punctuation, sentence casing).

Please preserve the original structure and wording as much as possible while making it grammatically correct and accurate to what was likely said.

Split the sentences in subtitle-friendly chunks (1-2 very short lines)

Answer by creating a subtitles.md file in the root of the project, in plain text format without any additional commentary or explanation
