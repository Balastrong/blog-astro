When you, as a contributor, want to create a new issue on GitHub, you're presented with a blank page and a text area to write your issue description.

import empty from './_1empty.png';

<Image src={empty} alt="Empty issue" />

If it's a feature request, you'd like to add all the relevant details and reasons why you think it's a good idea, to increase the chances of it being approved.

Speaking of nasty bugs, what you write in the issue body should hopefully be enough to let the maintainers understand what's going on and how to fix it and prevent similar issues in the future.

Everyone has their own way of writing issues and going in depth with details, which is great, but often times it's not the most efficient way.

In this 2 chapters series, we'll see how to use GitHub Issue Templates to help contributors write better issues.

You can find the full content in this video, or you can keep reading for Chapter 2.
