Three things you do **NOT** want in your repository:

1. Unformatted code
2. Warnings/errors
3. Failing tests

Is there an easy way to prevent these from happening? Sure, just make sure to format your code, run linters and launch your test suite right before pushing the code. And also, please tell your team to do the same.

What could go wrong? Everything :D

If a solution requires that people having to remember about doing something, you can be sure that it will not work.

## Git Hooks

A possible solution to automate this process is with Git Hooks. They are basically scripts that run automatically every time a specific event occurs in a Git repository. For example, you can run a script before `git commit` (format and lint) or before `git push` (tests).

You can also make the action fail (commit or push, in this case) if the related hook fails.

This already sounds great but there is a problem: Git Hooks are not part of the repository. They are stored locally in the `.git` folder, which is not versioned. This means that every time you or a colleague clone a repository, they have to set up the hooks again.

Looks like we're still falling into the same trap, people have to remember to do something manually. Not gonna work.

## Husky üê∂

Fear not! You can kindly ask a Husky to help you with that.

import husky from './_husky.jpg';

I mean, not the dog, but a really cool node package called [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

What husky does is mainly two things:

1. You can define git hooks in your repository and keep them versioned, so that everyone will have the code when cloning the repo.
2. It will automatically set up the hooks for you when you run `npm install` (or `yarn`), which means you can be faril sure that everyone will have them.

How cool is that? This actually covers the two main issues we had before!

## How to use it

I recorded a video where I go step by step through the process of setting up Husky in a repository, with two hooks:

- `pre-commit`: runs `prettier` and `eslint` on the staged files
- `pre-push`: runs the test suite

<YouTube id="" />

No time to watch the video, here's a quick summary:

### Prerequisites

In this example I will use `prettier` and `eslint` to format and lint the code. I will also use `lint-staged` to run the linters only on the staged files. If you don't have them yet, follow these simple steps:

```bash
npm install -D prettier lint-staged
```

For `eslint` you can indeed manually install it as a dev dependency and paste a config file, or you can run this command and follow the instructions:

```bash
npm init @eslint/config
```

This will run a simple CLI wizard that will end up generating a `.eslintrc` file for you and install the required dependencies.

Additionally, make sure to configure `lint-staged` to define what commands have to be executed on what files. An example:

```json
{
  "./src/**/*.{js,ts}": ["prettier --write", "eslint --max-warnings 0"]
}
```

This config runs `prettier` and `eslint` with the given arguments on all the `js` and `ts` files in the `src` folder.

### Husky Setup

You can follow the [official docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/getting-started.html) to set up Husky, but it's literally as easy as running this command:

```bash
npx husky-init && npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn dlx husky-init --yarn2 && yarn
```

This command will do everything for you, in partcular it will add on your package.json a `prepare` script that is what makes sure everyone has hooks installed after running `npm install` or `yarn`.

It will also create an example `pre-commit` hook in the `.husky` folder, which you can edit to add your own hooks.

### Pre-commit hook

Husky already generated it for us, but it contains `npm test` as an example.

In our case we want to replace it with `lint-staged`. You can do it via the CLI but it's also as easy as opening the file in `.husky/pre-commit` and replacing the last line with `npx lint-staged`.

Make sure to run again `npm install` or `yarn` to install the hook and you're done!

### Pre-push hook

This one is not generated by Husky, so we have to create it manually.

You can either manually create a file called `.husky/pre-push` or run this command:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npm test"
```

This will create the file and add the `npm test` command to it. Once again, run `npm install` or `yarn` so that the hook is properly set in your repository.

## Bypass Husky

Having too strict rules sometimes can be frustrating, especially when you're in a hurry and you just want to push your code and go home.

Husky allows you to bypass the hooks by adding the `--no-verify` flag to the command. For example:

```bash
git commit -m "My commit message" --no-verify
```

This will skip the hooks and allow you to commit your code.

However, now all commands support `--no-verify`, including `git push`.

In this case, you can manually disable husky for that run by setting the `HUSKY` environment variable to `0`:

```bash
HUSKY=0 git push
```

This will let you run the command without the hooks. If you run `git push` without the `HUSKY` variable, it will trigger the hooks as usual.

Now that you know how to bypass hooks, please, please, please, don't do it unless strictly necessary.

## Conclusion

If you cannot, or just don't want to, get the job done by pipelines, I highly recommend you to use this tool! It‚Äôs so simple to set up and it just works for everyone.

And that‚Äôs it! With husky you can make sure everyone in your team has all the required git hooks always set! Today we showcased only `pre-commit` and `pre-push`, but husky supports all available git hooks.

You can learn more about husky in the [official docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and you should definitely leave a star to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
