Classes and methods might get really long, making you lose context of what the code is about.

Visual Studio Code recently added a new cool feature you can enable in the settings, called **Sticky Scroll**.

When itâ€™s enabled, everytime you go deeper on a nesting level, the first row remains sticky at the top of editor.

Thanks to the project being Open Source, on vscode the are constantly new smart features every month. Some of them, even if small, are highly appreciable!

Here a short video to see it in action!
