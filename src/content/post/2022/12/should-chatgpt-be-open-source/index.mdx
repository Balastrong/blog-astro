That's a good question, right? So much power in a closed source... what could happen? Is it ok? Let's see what ChatGPT thinks about it:

_It is not possible for me to know whether ChatGPT, or any specific software, should be open source or not. The decision to open source a piece of software or keep it proprietary is typically made by the developers or owners of the software. There are a number of factors that may influence this decision, including the intended use of the software, the business model of the company or organization that develops it, and the level of community engagement desired._

_Open source software is typically made available to the public with a license that allows users to access, modify, and distribute the source code. This can facilitate collaboration and innovation, and may be a good choice for software that is intended to be widely used and improved upon by a community of developers. On the other hand, proprietary software is typically kept confidential and is only made available to users through a license agreement that limits access to the source code. This may be a good choice for software that is intended to be used internally within an organization or for software that is intended to generate revenue through sales or licensing._

_Ultimately, the decision to open source a piece of software is a complex one and will depend on a variety of factors. It is important to carefully consider the implications of open sourcing software and to make a decision that aligns with the goals and priorities of the organization or project._

Ok that was a good one, let's try with something more generlic like:

> Do you think AI in general should be Open Source or not?

_There are pros and cons to both open sourcing and keeping proprietary the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems._

_One argument in favor of open sourcing AI is that it can facilitate collaboration and innovation, as well as help to ensure that AI systems are developed and used ethically and responsibly. Open sourcing AI can allow researchers and developers from different organizations and countries to contribute to the advancement of the field and to identify and address any potential biases or other issues with AI systems. This can also help to build trust in AI and ensure that it is used for the benefit of society._

-On the other hand, there are also valid reasons for keeping AI proprietary. For example, a company or organization may want to keep its AI technology confidential for competitive reasons, or it may want to generate revenue by selling or licensing its AI products or services. Additionally, some AI systems may be used for sensitive applications, such as national security or healthcare, in which case it may be necessary to keep the technology confidential for security or privacy reasons.\_

_Ultimately, the decision to open source or keep proprietary AI systems will depend on the specific goals and priorities of the developers or owners of the technology, as well as the intended use and potential impact of the AI systems. It is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of both approaches and to make a decision that aligns with the values and objectives of the organization or project._

This might get a bit weird... let's see

> Should we be afraid of AI?

_Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to bring many benefits to society, such as improving healthcare, transportation, education, and more. However, it is important to recognize that AI can also pose risks and challenges, and it is important to carefully consider and address these risks as the technology develops._

_One potential concern about AI is that it may be used to harm individuals or groups, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, AI systems may be used to perpetuate or amplify biases or discrimination, or they may be used to manipulate or deceive people. It is important to carefully design, test, and evaluate AI systems to ensure that they are used ethically and responsibly._

_Another potential concern about AI is that it may lead to job displacement or other economic and social disruption. While AI has the potential to automate certain tasks and make certain industries more efficient, it could also lead to job loss or other negative impacts on workers. It is important to carefully consider and address these potential impacts as AI is developed and deployed._

_Overall, while AI has the potential to bring many benefits, it is important to carefully consider and address the risks and challenges that it may pose. This may involve developing and implementing responsible AI practices and policies, as well as engaging in ongoing dialogue and collaboration with various stakeholders._
