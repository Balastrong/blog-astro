If you're familiar with my content, you know I often talk about how to find new Open Source projects and repositories that are waiting our contributions.

However, I get quite often the request of showcasing some projects I know where I'm already a contribtor and if possible, beginner friendly ones.

The projects that came to my mind are:

- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) - TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference
- [LinkFree](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree) - A free, open-source alternative to LinkTree
- [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns) - Modern JavaScript date utility library
- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) - The famous code editor

LinkFree is plain Javascript while the three others are written in Typescript.

If you're interested in some of them, in this video I uploaded on YouTube you will find more details. In particular, I will briefly analize:

- Instructions to get started - Documentation
- Programming Language
- Community
- Extra notes and trivia

Happy Open Source Contributing!
