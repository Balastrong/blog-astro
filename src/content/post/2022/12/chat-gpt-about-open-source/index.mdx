Everyone is going crazy for ChatGPT so I wanted to give it a try myself. I'm not the best person to talk about AI or how it works under the hood, so I'll take this from a content creator perspective.

There are many claims that this technology can create content on behalf of the user so why not taking this challenge?

## The Question

I sent ChatGPT a simple prompt:

> Write the script for a YouTube video about the advantages of contributing to Open Source

The result? It answered with the script of this video:

<YouTube id="MAj7d8C5p3o" />

## And the title?

Yeah, why not? Actually I didn't even need to tell it the topic for the title, since it remembered my previous question.

I only asked ChatGPT to suggest a title, and these are the results:

1. "The Benefits of Contributing to Open Source"
1. "Why You Should Contribute to Open Source Projects"
1. "Gain Skills and Experience by Contributing to Open Source"
1. "The Power of Open Source: How Your Contributions Can Make a Difference"
1. "Open Soruce Contributions: A Career Boosting Opportunity"

import chatgpt_video_title from './_chatgpt-video-title.png';

## Full potential

This was a really simple experiment, I just read straight ahead the first result to see if it made sense and... it did!

However, this opens up to countless possibilities on using ChatGPT as a personal assistant, with ideas and suggestions to integrate to our own creations. Let's see how it will be used in the near future!

What do you think? Let me know in the comments!

## ChatGPT's script

If you're curious, here's the text it suggested:

_Hi there! In this video, we're going to be talking about the advantages of contributing to open source projects._

_Open source software is everywhere. It powers some of the most popular websites and applications that we use every day, from web browsers to mobile apps and more. And while many people use open source software, not everyone understands the benefits of contributing to these projects._

_One of the biggest advantages of contributing to open source is that it allows you to gain valuable experience and skills. Working on open source projects gives you the opportunity to learn from other experienced developers and to collaborate with them on real-world projects. This can be a great way to improve your coding skills and to build a portfolio of work that you can showcase to potential employers._

_Another advantage of contributing to open source is that it allows you to give back to the community. Open source software is often developed and maintained by volunteers who are passionate about their projects. By contributing to these projects, you can help to improve the software and make it more useful for others. This can be a great way to make a positive impact on the world and to help others who are using the software._

_In addition, contributing to open source can also help to boost your career. Many companies value employees who have experience working on open source projects, as it shows that they are passionate about their work and are willing to collaborate with others. This can make you a more attractive candidate for job opportunities and can even lead to career advancement._

_So, if you're a developer looking to gain experience, give back to the community, or boost your career, consider contributing to open source projects. You'll be helping to improve important software, and you'll be gaining valuable skills and experience along the way. Thanks for watching!_
