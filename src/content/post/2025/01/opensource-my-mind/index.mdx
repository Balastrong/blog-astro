import YouTube from '~/components/widgets/YouTube.astro';

I just realized that I should probably Open Source my mind. I wrote this script and recorded a video, you choose if you want to read or listen :D

### How 2025 has begun

Hey everyone, how is it going? For me, 2025 started quite terribly, I've been lying in bed with a really nasty flu for most of the year so far, which luckily means just 4 days.

I had big plans for this first week of the year, mixing between moments to recharge my batteries and some focused time to push on my side projects to learn something new. As usual, everything I learn I’m happy to bring it in the form of a youtube video for my channel, so that I can play with the new concepts first and then I’ll try to explain them in a tutorial-like piece of content.

Turns out the flu decided I couldn’t do that, at least not this week that technically I was on vacation and I had much more free time.

### Setting new plans

However, having my plans completely destroyed made me realize a thing. To be fair, I’ve got this on the back of my mind for a long time, but it never became this obvious until today. It’s time for a change.

The motto of my youtube channel is Learning Web Development through Open Source, that’s what I’ve been doing so far and this will remain valid also in 2025, but I’ll take a different approach on how I share my journey.

Here’s a thing I usually mention with my friends when they ask me how is my youtube journey going. I love to give value through tutorials, starting from a clear point A getting to a well defined point B. I’m so happy when I read the comments from many of you having their problem solved or a new skill acquired after watching one of my videos. But this has a long-term problem. Many of my viewers come from a google search, my video give them the solution (or maybe not!) and then they close the tab and we’ll never see each other again. I’m so sad about that!

If you’re not subscribed, you should subscribe now, but then if you see one of my videos in the homepage and it’s a tutorial about something you don’t care, well, you’re not gonna watch the video. Fair enough.

That’s what I want to change in my communication, instead of solving a single specific topic each time, I want to more broadly tell about how my journey is going. What I’m experimenting with, what problems I’m facing (even if I don’t yet have the solution!) and most importantly, all the thought process that goes behind that.

Especially in the era of AI solving all kind of technical problems, I believe there’s even more value in being human and that’s what I want to bring to the table: not just a collection of technical solutions but myself, as a human!

### What's gonna change

So here’s the clickbaity title: I want to Open Source my mind!

I will still do tutorials because I like doing them and I see they’re usually appreciated, but I want to mix my schedule with more unstructured or behind the scenes videos. Here’s an example: I’m working on a TanStack Start project I’m gonna use to record a tutorial but I’m still unsure on which database or backend as a service to use. One option is more powerful and lets me build faster, but it hides some of the features I want to showcase. Another option brings fewer features and requires more effort, but it better highlights TanStack Start’s capabilities. I haven’t decided yet and myself reasoning about it and comparing the options might be an interesting video! At least, that’s what I want to experiment and your views and comments will give me the answer!

On a separate branch I was also thinking about a creating a newsletter where I share what I’m currently doing, I’ll probably call it Behind the Dev or something like that. It will be a bit more personal and again just another way to create more human connection between me and you. Would you subscribe? If I make it happen I’ll probably add the link here below, I haven’t decided yet.

**UPDATE**: You can already subscribe here: [leonardomontini.dev/newsletter](https://leonardomontini.dev/newsletter)

### Wrapping up

With that said, I still have a tiny bit of fever but not enough to stop me writing and recording this video. If you watched it until this point I do really appreciate you, let me know what you think about this new style of videos and if you have any suggestion, please feel free to write a comment or send me a message.

Thanks for watching myself ramble for a few minutes, if you enjoyed it, I promise it’s gonna happen more often here on my channel.

I wish you a really happy and fulfilling 2025, take care and see you soon!
