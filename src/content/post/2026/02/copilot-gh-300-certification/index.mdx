Last week I passed the GitHub Copilot GH-300 certification exam. I've been using Copilot since 2023, basically since it launched, so I figured it would be a good first certification to go for: a topic I know well, a way to prove it to myself, and maybe fill in some gaps I didn't know I had.

## Preparing for the GH-300

The preparation was mostly straightforward. The official learning path is self-paced written content, and since I already know the features, I got through both courses in about 3 hours rather than the 8 hours estimated. The part that actually required studying was everything around enterprise and business plans: content exclusion policies, intellectual property, data management, licensing. As an individual Copilot user, I had never paid much attention to that side of things.

The practice exam scored me 92 on the first try, 96 the morning of the exam, but don't get too comfortable, the real exam is harder and has some questions that will genuinely make you think twice.

## The Pearson VUE Online Proctoring Experience

The online Pearson VUE setup was simpler than I expected. I went to the kitchen, took a few pictures of my surroundings, had one monitor and the webcam on, and that was it. No proctor on screen, no complicated room checks. Clean and straightforward.

## Is the GH-300 Certification Worth It?

If you're thinking about taking it, I walk through the full prep process, the exam format, and my honest take on whether certifications are actually worth it. The video is probably easier to follow than a written breakdown.
