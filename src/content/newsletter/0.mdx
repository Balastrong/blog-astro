At last... you took your choice üëÄ

import intro from './_img/0intro.png';

<Image src={intro} alt="So you have chosen... Subscribe" class="mx-auto" />

Welcome to my newsletter! Or... I should say... _knock knock_ can I enter your inbox?

This is all new to me, newsletters are a tool I always wanted to explore and you're now helping me figuring this out! So here's how we begin: thank you!

As mentioned when I announced it, I'd like this to be a place where I share a tiny bit of what's going on my mind, it can be for me a form of journaling and I hope it brings some value to you as well! Not because I'm particularly smart... but I think reading what's in someone else's mind can help seeing things from different perspectives and better understand what's in our own brain üß†

Isn't that a win-win?

I don't want the intro to be too long so that might be it for today, if you want to continue the conversations I begin here I think replies to the email should work (I hope, let me know!) and in any case I'm happy to talk about everything I mention on DMs or anywhere you like!

Let's see some sections I'm planning to add in the next issues üëá

### Open Source corner

Here's a slightly more technical section, at least more than the introduction.

The plan is to share here something that happened recently in the projects I'm involved, which nowadays means you'll get various TanStack updates.

I don't think I'm gonna cover projects I'm not actively following but this might change in case I happen to notice something worth sharing. Let's see :D

### Side projets

I'd like to have a section where I briefly mention the progress on side projects, that are not necessarily an actual product and not necessarily mine.

There's a thing I've got on my mind that is "Open Side Projects" or something similar, maybe with the word "Welcoming"... I don't know yet! The thing is, it would be cool for our own side projects to be as open as possible to contributions from everyone else - we can all learn together!

Do you have some side projects where you'd like to get some cooperation? I'll be happy to share the link here üîó

I should probably expand this idea in a video...

### Channel highlights

YouTube is an activity that takes a lot of my brain space and I'm enjoying it a lot, it had to have a section here.

It might be a mention of the previous video or some plans on what I'd like to do next.

This year started with me in bed with a nasty flu but it also made me realize I should experiment with new formats. I expand this topic in the video I recently published.

### Cool picks

I heard newsletters usually have some cool links, should I have such a section?

I'll start with:

- [grep.app](https://grep.app/): A tool (recently acquired by Vercel) that searches for code on 500.000 public Github repos. Cool to take inspirations and find "real" examples.

### Thanks for reading!

Aaaand that's it! Thanks for being among the first 27 who blindly subscribed, I really hope you enjoyed and please if you have feedback or suggestions I'd LOVE to hear from you!

Thanks again and see you next... week? Yeah I'll begin with a weekly frequence and maybe tweak it later.

See ya ‚ù§Ô∏è<br />
