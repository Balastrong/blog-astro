Hey there, how is it going? Today's main topic is gonna be hot üî•

import intro from './_img/4intro.png';

LinkedIn is a weird place, but it's probably not the platform to blame, it's on the people.

I've been renewed as a GitHub Star for 2025 and I'm really grateful for that. As usual for this kind of exciting news I made a post on LinkedIn, that's what the platform is about right?

However, each time I have something I'm proud to share, there's something on the back of my mind... those people complaining or making jokes of other people celebrating their own stuff.

Something easy to notice (at least on my bubble) happens in mid-january when the feed is flooded of "I'm on top 3% of Sessionize" posts or when Microsft MVPs are renewed later during the year.

Events like these are always followed by mocking posts and comments.

So the question is, why shouldn't people be allowed to celebrate something they're proud of? What is allowed and what is not?

It seems that according to someone, in order to be allowed to celebrate it has to be something truly unique and universally recognized. And not too many people can celebrate about it at the same time!

I mean... I also find it somehow funny when half of my feed is about that "3% on sessionize" thing but I also see that each single post is actually a human being celebrating something that matters to them.

Who earned that achievement actually spent time and effort doing the thing and now that it's time to celebrate... they should feel bad or mocked?

Why are (some) people so mean to each other?

### Open Source corner

Looking for TanStack Start resources? A few days ago I launched an awesome-list for that!

Here's the repo: https://github.com/Balastrong/awesome-tanstack-start

The official doc is already great but to make the ecosystem even better it's super useful to collect all kind of examples, boilerplates, integrations and educational content in one place.

If you know some resources that aren't there yet please raise a PR! And since you're around, you can also leave a star on the repo ‚≠êÔ∏è

(Don't know what an aswesome-list is, [here's an old video I made](https://youtu.be/dqp-JFb1Upg))

### Channel highlights

<YouTube id="vmCBMLw35oI" />

I've been thinking... there are some tips I want to share but they're often not enough content for at least a 3/4 minutes video so I keep them in the backlog and they remain there.

I tried a new setup for shorts that makes it easy for me to record and edit the video, I gave it a quick try with this one mentioning the awesome-tanstack-start repo but I've got a few more planned.

If you like short videos with bits of cool info, stay tuned!

### Cool picks

I've got a really cool pick about TanStack Start but I didn't want to make this newsletter monothematic so I'll leave it for next week.

- [no hello](https://nohello.net/): when you get that "hello" message on slack and then the real message 2 hours later

### Thanks for reading!

Sending this on a Sunday afternoon, I'm already late with newsletters üòÖ

At least I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts, if you have feedback please please send me a message and let's talk about it!

Thank you!<br />
