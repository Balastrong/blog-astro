Hey everyone, let's continue from where we left last week:

import intro from './_img/2intro.png';

<Image src={intro} alt="Marked safe from doing AI Demos" class="mx-auto" />

I mentioned the AI event that took place... yesterday! Everything went smooth, Copilot cooperated and I've been able to show pretty much everything I had planned on my routine. And the audience appreciated the memes on my slides ðŸ‘€

But enough talking about AI, let's get back to the humans. You know what I like the most about that kind of events? Meeting with people living in my area.

The region I live in, Marche, is not that densely populated. Tech events here aren't much common and there's only one large and active community that usually gathers about... 15/20 people on evening events. It ain't much, but it's honest work.

Yesterday, however, we were more than a 100! An unmatched success!

I believe the value you get from hearing from "colleagues" in other companies is unmatched, I loved the conversations we had during the day and the dinner together.

If there's a local community in your area go attend their events and help them organize more! If there isn't... it's your time to shine and create a new community! âœ¨

### Side projets

Here's one more reason why I added this section on my newsletter, to feel guilty when I don't touch (almost) any of my side projects during the week!

I better have some updates next time :D

### Channel highlights

This might be one of those tiny details that can make such a difference. Creating a custom link component is a common usecase and the answer isn't "just wrap TanStack's Link component" as you would lose the awesome typesafety you have.

You can make it work with some tricks or tradeoffs... or you can use the createLink function!

The TanStack Router series is the most successful on my channel and as a real professional I didn't post any video on that playlist for months. It was due time to get back on this!

### Cool picks

- [Don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/): here's a good answer if you're annoyed by people sending messages like "Can I ask you a question?" o "Is there anyone who can assist me for a thing?".

### Thanks for reading!

The last few days I've been mostly focused on preparing the Copilot session and I barely had the time to write this newsletter, sorry for it being so short today!

Thank you!<br />
